############################# ACTUAL ALGORITHM ###################
    
W = 10000 #the size of our knapsack, which is important for the cycle
tot_items = 100 #number of items we use in our problem, what here we refere with x

#instance of the knapsack

knapsack = []
#from here, the knapsack is just an empty container. What we need to do is, initally
#fill the first column with 0. The array is composed with tot_items+1 as number of columns
#and W+1 as number of rows

#for now, just create an empty matrix, using None



knapsack = [[0 for x in range(W+1)] for y in range(tot_items+1)] #just a short-hand notation for setting-up the matrix
#nothing really too fancy

#the algorithm is easy, truly speaking, but knowing the procedure is somewhat painful. The algorithm simply scans throught the knapsack
#matrix, comparing the values we stored in. If the value of the element we are currently seeing is greater than the previous one, we use 
#that element, in other case, we simply add the previous one
i=1
x=0
while(i <= tot_items): #cycle throught the columns
    x= elements[i-1][1]+1
    while(x <= W):
            value1 = knapsack[i-1][x] #first value we use to solve the problem
            value2 = knapsack[i-1][x - elements[i-1][1]] + elements[i-1][0] #just finding the other element we're interested in
            knapsack[i][x] = max(value1,value2) #setting a compare

            x=x+1
    i=i+1


print(knapsack[i-1][x-1]) #problem solved. ntr this is NOT the optimal solution, cause we can't traceback the items and so we can't output 
#how the solution was solved, truly speaking
